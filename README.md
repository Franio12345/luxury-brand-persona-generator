## ‚ú® Vision & Mission

The mission of this project is to serve as a cornerstone portfolio piece for **DigitalHus.com**, reflecting a unique capability to merge hospitality excellence, luxury storytelling, and technology into client-winning digital experiences.

The application guides users through an interactive quiz to reveal one of twelve primary brand archetypes (e.g., The Sage, The Creator, The Ruler). The experience culminates in a beautiful, shareable summary card that outlines the brand's core identity, complete with a dynamically generated tagline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Showcase & Features

This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate a command of modern, professional web development practices. The code is clean, scalable, and adheres to the highest standards of quality.

### Core Features:
